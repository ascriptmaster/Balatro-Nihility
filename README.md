# Nihility
This mod adds the challenge "Nihility" to Balatro, in which all cards are debuffed. To make Ante 1 winnable, you start with $8 and a single Joker. Good luck!

## Installation
This mod uses the Steamodded loader. Installation instructions for the loader can be found [here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started). The Lua file can be placed directly in the `Mods` directory; the surrounding directory is not necessary.

It currently only works on Steamodded 0.9.8. Support for Steamodded 1.0.0 is underway.
